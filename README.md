🏛️ MIRATHI: The Digital Succession Infrastructure

"Protecting Legacies, Automating Justice."

1. Introduction

Mirathi (Swahili for Inheritance or Legacy) is an Intelligent Succession Copilot designed to revolutionize how estates are managed and distributed in Kenya.

In the current landscape, the death of a loved one often triggers a second tragedy: a bureaucratic nightmare of lost documents, family feuds, and legal paralysis. The Kenyan court system is overwhelmed with succession cases, many of which stall for years due to simple clerical errors or lack of guidance.

Mirathi is not just a database; it is a Digital Lawyer. It is a deterministic, rule-based system that understands the Law of Succession Act (Cap 160), the Marriage Act, and the Children Act. It bridges the gap between the messy reality of family life and the rigid requirements of the Judiciary, ensuring that by the time a case reaches the court registry, it is accurate, compliant, and ready for approval.

2. The Problem: The Kenyan Succession Crisis

The process of transferring assets from a deceased person to their heirs in Kenya is broken.

🔴 1. The Information Void

Most Kenyans die Intestate (without a Will). Families are left guessing what assets exist. This contributes to the estimated KES 50 Billion+ sitting in Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority (UFAA) accounts because heirs simply don’t know the money exists.

🔴 2. The "Polygamy Puzzle" (Section 40)

Kenyan law recognizes polygamous unions, where distribution must happen "By House" (according to each wife). Manual processing of these complex family trees often leads to the exclusion of houses, triggering decades-long court battles.

🔴 3. Procedural Paralysis

The High Court requires specific forms (P&A 80, P&A 5, P&A 12) filed in a specific order. A single mistake—like forgetting a Chief’s Letter or miscalculating a filing fee—can cause a file to be rejected and stuck in "Pending" for months.

🔴 4. Vulnerability of Heirs (Section 26/29)

In the chaos of death, vulnerable groups (widows and minors) are often disinherited. Without a system to enforce Section 29 (Dependants), greedy relatives can hide assets or exclude children born out of wedlock.

🔴 5. The Cost Barrier

Hiring a lawyer for a standard succession cause costs between KES 50,000 to KES 300,000. This makes justice inaccessible for the average Kenyan family with a small estate.

3. The "What If" Campaign (Our Vision)

We built Mirathi to answer these questions:

What if you didn't need to know the law to follow the law?

What if the system automatically flagged that a minor child was missing a guardian before you tried to file?

What if family consent (Form P&A 38) could be collected via SMS links instead of dragging 10 siblings to a lawyer's office?

What if the "Math of Inheritance" (Hotchpot and Solvency) was calculated instantly by an engine, eliminating human bias?

What if your phone told you exactly what to do next, like a GPS for the court system?

4. System Objectives

Democratize Access: Reduce the cost of succession administration by automating the routine legal work.

Enforce Economic Truth: Provide an irrefutable, audit-trailed inventory of assets and debts to prevent fraud by executors.

Protect the Vulnerable: Systematically block any process that excludes minors or dependants (enforcing S.29 and S.71 of the LSA).

Accelerate the Courts: Feed the Judiciary system with "Perfect Files"—applications that are 100% complete and verified, reducing the backlog for judges.

5. The Solution: Three Pillars of Intelligence

Mirathi is architected around three distinct domains that mirror the real world.

🏗️ Pillar 1: Family & Identity (The "Who")

Function: Establishes the Biometric & Kinship Truth.

Innovation: It explicitly models Polygamous Houses (S.40) and Guardianship Authority (Children Act). It validates identity against national standards ensuring the "John Doe" claiming to be a son is a verified entity.

🏗️ Pillar 2: Estate & Inventory (The "Value")

Function: Establishes the Economic Truth.

Innovation: A real-time Solvency Radar. It prevents an Executor from distributing money if the estate is insolvent (Debts > Assets). It enforces Section 45 Priority, ensuring funeral expenses are paid before personal loans.

🏗️ Pillar 3: Succession Automation (The "Process")

Function: The Digital Lawyer.

Innovation: It runs a Readiness Assessment. It calculates a "Ready-to-File" score (0-100%). It generates the legal bundle only when the case is legally watertight.

6. Core Features
✅ 1. Legally Compliant Document Preparation

The system does not just "upload" files; it interrogates them.

Context Detection: The system detects if the case is Islamic (requires Kadhi’s Court forms), Testate (requires Probate), or Small Estate (requires Summary Administration).

S.35 Hotchpot Calculator: It automatically adjusts inheritance shares based on gifts given during the deceased's lifetime, ensuring mathematical fairness required by law.

✅ 2. Court-Ready Forms Generation

Mirathi eliminates the need for a typist.

The Engine: It pulls data from the Family and Estate services to auto-populate:

Form P&A 80: Petition for Letters of Administration.

Form P&A 5: Petition for Summary Administration.

Form P&A 12: Affidavit of Means (Assets & Liabilities).

Form P&A 38: Consent of Household (Digital Signatures).

Result: The user downloads a single, perfect PDF bundle ready for printing or e-filing.

✅ 3. Decision-Support and Workflow Guidance (The GPS)

Succession is a journey. Mirathi provides the map via the Executor Roadmap.

Dynamic Tasks: If the user marks the estate as "Intestate," the system adds a task: "Obtain Letter from Area Chief." If "Testate," it adds: "Validate Will Witnesses."

Dependency Locking: The system locks the "Distribute Assets" phase until the "Confirmation of Grant" phase is complete. This prevents illegal intermeddling with estate property.

8. Future Roadmap & Extensibility

Mirathi is built on a microservices architecture, allowing for powerful future integrations:

USSD Integration: Allowing rural users to register deaths and give family consent via feature phones (*123#).

Government Registry API: Direct integration with IPRS (Identity) and Ardhisasa (Lands) to validate Title Deeds in real-time.

Fintech Integration: "Probate Financing" – lending against the locked assets of the estate to pay for funeral or court fees.

Blockchain Wills: Storing the hash of a Will on a blockchain to prevent tampering or "lost" wills.

AI Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing family chat logs or dispute flags to predict the likelihood of a court objection before it happens.

9. Conclusion

Mirathi is not just a convenience tool; it is a structural fix for a systemic problem. By codifying the Law of Succession Act into software, we reduce the burden on the courts, protect vulnerable heirs from disinheritance, and ensure that the legacy of every Kenyan is honored with dignity, speed, and truth.
